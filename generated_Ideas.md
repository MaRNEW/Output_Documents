## Ideas Generated from MaRNEW

### This Document
This document lists the ideas generated from the [MaRNEW Workshop](https://www.iab.org/activities/workshops/marnew/) related to network management of encrypted traffic in radio networks. Currently this list is __incomplete__. 

After the list has been completed the MaRNEW Programme Committee and Attendees will work on distilling this list into a smaller list of feasible options and plan on bringing these to the IETF in some form. 

### Ideas List
Ideas generated from the workshop are included here, this list is still being added to.

* IETF gain an understanding of RAN
* Reviews and comments on 3GPP perspective
* AQM
* __Evolving TCP (or evolving transport)__
  * Congestion Control
  * SPROUT (MIT)
  * PCC (Performance & Congestion Control)
* How to do congestion controlling in RAN
  * Base Station
  * Controller that can adapt to a radio environment and provide a better experience, and preserve E2E
* Identify traffic types via 5-tuple
* Heuristics (for best effort only?)
* CDNs / caches in the network
* CDN improvements
* Mobile Throughput Guidance
* One bit for latency bandwidth tradeoff
* Small amount of data from network to user (ECN)
* API for app to query network, or vice versa
* Blind Caching
* Standard approach for operator to offer services to Content Providers
* Better Collaboration
* Sharing information hop by hop
* Metrics and metric standards
* Testing / Debugging
* Trust model / framework (e.g. for spud)
* Keyless SSL
* Meaningful capacity sharing; reacting correctly to wireless link layer condition
